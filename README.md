**Outline**

- Utilize a level of styling which is used in the modern world to present a clean site.
- Allow the app to be easily navigated through a mindful UX design.
- Play music provided by the API to give the app full functionality.

**TODO**
- Swap the site from using the Shazam API to something Spotify based, for this app to become a spotify client.
